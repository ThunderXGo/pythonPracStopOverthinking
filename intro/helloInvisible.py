"""
Loudspeaker announcements are often repeated to make sure people hear them!

Here's a program that repeats announcements for you.

1.
Run the program to see what it does.

The message variable is used twice to repeat the announcement.

2.
Update the program so that it announces something different:

Free ice cream!
I repeat:
Free ice cream!
​
You'll need to update the message variable, by setting it to the new value!

3.
Mark your program, fix any errors, run and mark it again.

Comments
The red lines starting with a hash (#) are comments. They are ignored when you run the code.

# Set the message:
message = "Bart Simpson to the principal's office!"

# Print the announcement:
print(message)
print('I repeat:')
print(message)
